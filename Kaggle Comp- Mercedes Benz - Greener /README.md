# Kaggle Competition - Mercedes Benz Greener Manufacturing
#### In this competition, Daimler is challenging Kagglers to tackle the curse of dimensionality and reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Competitors will work with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms will contribute to speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimlerâ€™s standards.

#### Most part of the code was available in kernels present for the respective competitions, and from that an idea what has to be done becomes clear. XGBoost has been implemented on the dataset by modelling data in different ways, then PCA, ICA and truncated SVD has been applied and data is again modelled. The unique thing that i did with my project is I used H2O to calculate the metrics for the given dataset , for that the raw dataset with useful features is used. Then finally stacking algorithm is used.
